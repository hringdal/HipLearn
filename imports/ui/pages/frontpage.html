                    Why HipLearn?

                    HipLearn is designed for you, with the sole purpose of making your student life a little bit
                    easier.
                    As students ourselves, we often experience that we use a lot of time each day just to figure
                    what to read,
                    where to start, and how to get the best control of the curriculum. Sometimes you have read some
                    pages here, and a chapter
                    there, which makes you lose control of where in the book you should read this time. Our goal is
                    to help you reach you goals with HipLearn.
                    HipLearn makes your learning process a little easier.

                How does HipLearn work?
            </h2>
            <p class="us">
                HipLearn is an application designed to give you full control of exactly how much of your
                curriculum you have been through, so that you always know how to use your own time best
                possible.
                HipLearn gives you the opportunity to register your subjects, and then fetches the chapters in
                your book. When you have read a chapter or a subchapter of a book in a subject, you cross it of
                the list so that next time, you remember how far you got.

                Who are we?

                We are a team of engaged students of technology. From left: Ingeborg Lianes, Håkon Ringdal and
                Janne Nesse.
                As students, we know the challenges students usually encounter, and we try to use our technical
                competence
                to solve those problems. Many students have a lot to do, and it can be hard to keep track of
                everything during a
                hectic semester. We cannot solve everything for you, but we can make it easier for you to keep
                track of your studies.
